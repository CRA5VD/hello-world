# hello-world
My first respository
I am currently a student at Wilberforce University, majoring in information Systems Management . I am interested in back-end development (PHP, PYTHON, RUBY RAILS, and SQL). I am currently teaching myself SQL and PHP. I would like to eventually get my MCSA and become a developer. I would love to network with developers and programmers for tips and constructive crictism.
